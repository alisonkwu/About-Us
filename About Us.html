            <h2>FCSN Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>FCSNâ€™s mission is to help individuals with special needs and their families find love, hope, respect, and support through integrated community involvement.<br>
                    FCSN provides information and assistance to children with special needs, adults with special needs, and their communities.  We provide opportunities for individuals with special needs to give back to their community through volunteer work and jobs.<br>
                    FCSN believes in the power of families helping families and promotes peer support through our many programs and events.  We emphasize family involvement and the integration of special-needs children and adults with their regular peers.<br>
                    FCSN is committed to opening the discussion about people with special needs by listening to and learning from them and their families. We train our youth volunteers to understand those with disabilities and develop their leadership skills. We thank our many student volunteers and adult volunteers for their continuous support and assistance.<br>
                    We strive to create a secure community in which individuals can learn, grow, and interact.
                </p>

            <h2>UC Davis Branch</h2>

                <p>
                    Friends of Children with Special Needs at UC Davis works closely with local non-profit organization Friends of Children With Special Needs to provide students with volunteer and 
                    leadership opportunities. Our club is dedicated to channeling hope, support and awareness towards the special needs community. We work closely with FCSN to bridge the gap between
                     the neurotypical and the special needs community. We also organize fundraisers for children with special needs in different parts of the world to support them in their education. 
                     Above all, we strive to reduce the stigma surrounding the special needs community and to encourage strong, loving bonds between the special needs community and the society as a whole.
